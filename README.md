# Google Time Lamp Manual

In this manual, I will desribe how you can connect your Google Calender with your NodeMCU and how te change the colors of a LED strip based on events noted in your calender. 

I will guide you through the entire procces, but if you still get stuck somewhere, don't be afraid to take a look at the '*Common Errors*' chapter at the end of this manual. This manual is split into different chapters, each of these aim at completing a specific task (such as downloading the Google API, changing the colors depending on your calender, etc.).

Keep in mind that this manual is specifically made for the NodeMCU ESP8266, if you use something else, you may still find some parts of this manual usefull, but the specific code may be incorrect.



## What do you need?

- NodeMCU (2x)
- Google Calender API
- LED strip
- A laptop or desktop
- Arduino IDE (Application)
- Adafruit account (Website)
- Voice detector (Optional)



## How to connect google calendar to a NodeMCU to influence different lights.

### Connecting Google Calender

#### Step 1 creating an Adafruit account
Go to the Adafruit website and create an account if you don't already have one.
https://io.adafruit.com/LeonVanDeursen/overview

#### Step 2 Creating a new Feed
In the navigation bar at the top of the screen is an option 'IO'. Click this option and afterwards click on 'Feeds' and an '+ New Feed'. We need this feed for later when we want multiple NodeMCU's to communicate with eachother.

#### Step 3 Naming the new feed
After clicking on the '+ New Feed' action, a pop up will show up where we need to give our feed a name and description. We need to call upon this name multiple times during this manual and while coding so a simple name that is memorable is prefered. I will name my feed 'TimeLamp'. A desription is optional, so I will leave mine empty, but you can fill in whatever you want.

#### Step 4 Opening the feed
After naming and creating the feed it will show up on your screen under all your feeds. When opening it it will look something like this:

Leave it open for now. We need this later down the line.
